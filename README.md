Nord modular G2 open source editor

This repository contains three generations of editors for the Nord G2 synthesizer that I created over the years. 

The software is written in the Delphi object pascal language using the later Delphi compilers, these have the extension XE (XE2, XE3... etc) and still later DX. The later compilers can produce binaries for Windows, Osx, Adroid, iOS and Linux. There is a free version available of the Delphi compiler but that one can only produce binaries for Windows 32 bit, but you should be able to compile the sources with it.

There are 3 generations of the open source G2 editor:

Gen1: this is a Windows only editor. 
Gen1: this can be compiled for Windows and OsX
Gen3: this is meant to be an Android editor, but can also be compiled for the other operating systems.
